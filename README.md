## üìú Script Index

| Script Name                           | Purpose                                           |
|--------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| `Create-ResourceGroup.ps1`           | Creates a new Azure Resource Group                |
| `Check-And-Create-RG.ps1`            | Checks if an RG exists, creates it if not        |
| `Check-RG-And-Deploy-VM.ps1`         | Deploys a VM if credits are enough               |
| `Check-RG-And-Deploy-VM-VARIANT.ps1` | Same as above with customizable input            |
| `Check-RG-Deploy-Interactive.ps1`    | Interactive prompts for RG + region + credits    |
| `Delete-ResourceGroup.ps1`           | Deletes an existing RG safely with confirmation  |

## üöÄ What Each Script Does

### `Create-ResourceGroup.ps1`
Creates a new Azure Resource Group using PowerShell and the `Az` module.

### `Check-And-Create-RG.ps1`
Checks if a given resource group exists. If not, creates it in the specified location.

### `Check-RG-And-Deploy-VM.ps1`
Deploys a VM *only* if the user has sufficient fake "credits" (for simulation/training).

### `Check-RG-And-Deploy-VM-VARIANT.ps1`
Same logic as above but allows you to easily customize RG name, location, and credit threshold.

### `Check-RG-Deploy-Interactive.ps1`
Interactive script that asks the user for RG name, location, and available credits, then decides whether to deploy a VM.

### `Delete-ResourceGroup.ps1`
Deletes a specified resource group ‚Äî but only if it exists and the user confirms the deletion.
